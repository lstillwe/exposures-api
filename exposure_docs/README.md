## General Spatio-temporal Exposure Model

**Goal**: Produce a stratification model for each socioenvironmental and drug exposure measure in order to compare patient subpopulations based on drug versus outcome measure (ED visits).A general spatial-temporal exposure model:[1] A patient will be on a specific drug for a certain time period `[Ts,Te]`.  During that time period, we can consider they spend a portion of their time at different locations `[L1:D1, L2:D2, ..., LN:DN]` where `Lx` is a location of interest (geospatial coordinates) and `Dx` is the percentage of time spent in that location, `n = 1…N`.  For instance, a patient may spend 50% of time at work and 50% at home.  `Ts` and `Te` can be a date or a date and time. A (socio)environmental exposure estimate for a patient can then be computed using the input `Expest = [Ts,Te,L1:D1,L2:D2,...,:LN:DN]`**Caveat**: This model doesn't explicitly take account of time of day or time of year, but Expest could be readily be expanded to include those variables.**Caveat**: Other comparisons may be made, in addition to drug versus outcome measure (ED visits).**Caveat**: The time interval may also involve a specific period of time prior to (or after) diagnosis or adverse event, and we may want to calculate exposure 'scores' during that time interval**Caveat**: this doesn't handle travel well (e.g., commute routes, or driving along a road(s) unless the road is considered a location)***Note**: For airborne exposures, we are working with UNC’s Institute for the Environment to develop more complex models that take account factors such as time of day, seasonal conditions, humidity levels, wind flow, etc. (See comment on page 2.)For several measures, we will want to calculate daily exposure “scores” (`DES`) over the time period `[Ts,Te]`:For example, for PM2.5, daily exposure ‘scores’ are:[2]

```DESpm = 1 if 24h max PM2.5 < 4.0 μg/m3DESpm = 2 if 24h max PM2.5 4.0-7.06 μg/m3DESpm = 3 if 24h max PM2.5 7.07-8.97 μg/m3DESpm = 4 if 24h max PM 2.5 8.98-11.36 μg/m3DESpm = 5 if 24h max PM2.5 > 11.37 μg/m3
```From the daily scores, we can then calculate exposure scores for a smaller time interval within `[Ts,Te]`.For example, for PM2.5, we are interested in calculating overall 7- and 14-day `DES` exposure scores:

```DES7pm = (DESpm1+DESpm2…DESpm7)/7DES14pm = (DESpm1+DESpm2…DESpm14)/14
```Note: The 7- and 14-day exposure scores are calculated with respect to the day of interest and the 6- and 13-days prior to that dateCaveat: For certain measures (e.g., poverty/non-poverty), the Expest measure will be the same as the `DES` and `DES7` and `DES14` values.

- Traffic-related air pollutants are elevated levels near roads, including PM2.5, ultrafine PM(currently unregulated), VOCs, NO, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pollutant levels demonstrate steep gradients in concentrations and typically reach background levels at distances of 150 to 200 m from the road.- High traffic/high diesel (HD), defined as homes within 150 m of roads with >6,000 commercial vehicles/day (commercial annual average daily traffic; CAADT) and >90,000 total vehicles/day (annual average daily traffic; AADT). High traffic/low diesel (LD), defined as homes within 150 m of roads with >90,000 AADT and <4,500 commercial vehicles/day. Low traffic (LT) homes located >300 m from roads with >25,000 AADT and greater than 500 m from roads with >90,000 AADT.- US DOT roadway data include: number of lanes, roadway type (e.g., freeway, arterial), AADT, average speed, and eight vehicle types (heavy duty diesel, light duty gas, …).[2] Mirabelli MC, Vaidyanathan A, Flanders WD, Qin X, Garbe P.
