- Near-roadway EXposure and Urban air pollutant Study (NEXUS) air pollution epidemiology study.
- Summary: exposure based on exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and diesel exhaust emissions near roadways.  
- Exposures impact: exacerbation of asthma, asthma onset, impaired lung function, card1iovascular morbidity, and mortality, adverse birth outcomes, and cognitive decline
- Relevance: In the US, an estimated 40 million people in the U.S. live within 100 m of major roads, railways or airports (7) and millions more commute on major roads, suggesting the importance of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants for public health.

Important notes:

- Traffic-related air pollutants are elevated levels near roads, including PM2.5, ultrafine PM
(currently unregulated), VOCs, NO, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pollutant levels demonstrate steep gradients in concentrations and typically reach background levels at distances of 150 to 200 m from the road.
- High traffic/high diesel (HD), defined as homes within 150 m of roads with >6,000 commercial vehicles/day (commercial annual average daily traffic; CAADT) and >90,000 total vehicles/day (annual average daily traffic; AADT). High traffic/low diesel (LD), defined as homes within 150 m of roads with >90,000 AADT and <4,500 commercial vehicles/day. Low traffic (LT) homes located >300 m from roads with >25,000 AADT and greater than 500 m from roads with >90,000 AADT.
- US DOT roadway data include: number of lanes, roadway type (e.g., freeway, arterial), AADT, average speed, and eight vehicle types (heavy duty diesel, light duty gas, …).
